A simple Yammer application that exports contents of Yammer group to a file suitable
for use with fortune command.

My instance is deployed on OpenShift at http://yfortune-lr666.rhcloud.com/

If you're going to hack on this, just fork it and fill in your App's credentials.
To debug without being deployed on web, just fill in $token you'll obtain
manually and perhaps $group_id and run directly from the shell.

The rate limiting thing might be a bit fragile -- we have to be slow enough to avoid
excessive delays, but fast enough not to trigger an OpenShift gateway timeout.

Love,
Lubo
